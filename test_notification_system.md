# Notification System Test Results

## Implementation Summary

✅ **COMPLETED**: Notification system for Android app settings changes, specifically for proxy settings modifications.

### What was implemented:

1. **Notification Infrastructure** in `SettingsActivity.kt`:
   - `showNotification(message: String)` method using Snackbar
   - Integrated with all proxy setting change handlers

2. **Proxy Setting Notifications**:
   - Proxy type selection: "Proxy type updated to: $entryVal"
   - Proxy host changes: "Proxy host updated to: $newHost"
   - Proxy port changes: "Proxy port updated to: $newPort"
   - Proxy username changes: "Proxy username updated"
   - Proxy password changes: "Proxy password updated"
   - Proxy credentials toggle: "Proxy credentials enabled/disabled"

3. **Layout Updates** in `activity_settings.xml`:
   - Added missing ID `settings_proxy_choice_layout` for theming consistency

4. **TextInputLayout Theming**:
   - Existing `themeTextInputLayouts()` method already handles theming
   - Removed duplicate `applyTextInputLayoutTheming()` method to avoid redundancy
   - Method is called in `onResume()` to ensure proper theming

### Code Changes Made:

#### In SettingsActivity.kt:
- Added `showNotification()` method for snackbar notifications
- Integrated notification calls in all proxy setting change handlers:
  - Proxy type dropdown selection
  - Proxy host/port/username/password field changes
  - Proxy credentials switch toggle

#### In activity_settings.xml:
- Added `android:id="@+id/settings_proxy_choice_layout"` to proxy choice TextInputLayout

### Testing Status:
- ✅ Code compiles successfully without errors
- ✅ All TextInputLayout elements have proper IDs for theming
- ✅ Notification system is integrated with all proxy setting changes
- ✅ Existing theming infrastructure is utilized efficiently

### Technical Notes:
- Uses Material Design Snackbar for notifications (LENGTH_SHORT duration)
- Follows existing code patterns in the codebase
- Maintains compatibility with existing theming system
- No duplicate code - reuses existing theming functionality

## Expected User Experience:

When users modify proxy settings in the Android app:
1. Change proxy type → See "Proxy type updated to: [selected type]"
2. Modify proxy host → See "Proxy host updated to: [new host]"
3. Change proxy port → See "Proxy port updated to: [new port]"
4. Update username → See "Proxy username updated"
5. Change password → See "Proxy password updated"
6. Toggle credentials → See "Proxy credentials enabled" or "Proxy credentials disabled"

All notifications appear as brief snackbar messages at the bottom of the settings screen.
